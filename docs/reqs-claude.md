# Corporate Chatbot Platform - Requirements Document

## Overview

A reusable, enterprise-grade chatbot platform designed for corporate websites that leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities, intelligent routing, and comprehensive monitoring. The platform will be deployable across different organizations with minimal configuration changes.

## Core Architecture Requirements

### Multi-Tenant Design
- **Configurable per organization**: Support multiple organizations with isolated data and configurations
- **White-label capability**: Customizable branding, styling, and messaging per organization
- **Environment-based configuration**: All organization-specific settings managed via environment variables or configuration files

> **Question**: Do you need true multi-tenancy (single deployment serving multiple orgs) or separate deployments per organization? This affects database design and security considerations.

### Frontend Integration
- **JavaScript Widget**: Embeddable widget that can be integrated into any corporate website
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility
- **Customizable UI**: Configurable colors, positioning, and styling to match corporate branding
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight implementation with minimal external dependencies

> **Suggestion**: Consider providing multiple integration options (iframe embed, npm package, CDN script) for different technical requirements.

## Intelligence Layer

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **Document Ingestion**: Support for multiple document formats (PDF, Word, HTML, plain text, structured data)
- **Chunking Strategy**: Configurable document chunking with overlap settings
- **Embedding Generation**: Generate and store embeddings for knowledge base content
- **Similarity Search**: Retrieve relevant context based on user queries
- **Source Attribution**: Track and display sources used in responses

> **Question**: What document ingestion methods do you prefer? File upload interface, API endpoints, or automated crawling of websites/documentation?

### Intelligent Query Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Rate Limiting
- **Implementation**: Redis-based token bucket algorithm
- **Configurable Limits**: Per-user, per-IP, and global rate limits
- **Graceful Degradation**: Appropriate error messages when limits exceeded

#### 2. Relevance Filtering
- **Intent Classification**: Determine if query is relevant to the organization's domain
- **Confidence Scoring**: Threshold-based filtering for low-confidence queries
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful responses for out-of-scope questions

#### 3. Cache Layer
- **Semantic Similarity**: Find previously answered similar questions using vector similarity
- **Cache Hit Optimization**: Return cached responses for near-identical queries
- **Cache Invalidation**: Strategies for updating cached responses when knowledge base changes

> **Question**: What similarity threshold should trigger a cache hit? Should users be notified when receiving a cached response?

#### 4. Routing Logic (LangGraph Integration)
- **Model Selection**: Route queries to appropriate LLM based on:
  - Query complexity assessment
  - Question type classification (factual, conversational, technical)
  - RAG requirement determination
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Escalate to more powerful models if initial response is inadequate
- **Cost Optimization**: Use cheaper models for simple queries, reserve expensive models for complex ones

#### 5. Authentication Node
- **Conditional Activation**: Trigger authentication for account-specific queries
- **Multi-Factor Options**: 
  - SMS-based OTP to registered mobile number
  - Email-based OTP to registered email address
- **Session Management**: Maintain authenticated state during conversation
- **Security**: Secure token generation and validation

> **Question**: How long should authentication sessions last? Should there be different authentication levels for different types of information?

## State and Conversation Management

### Session Handling
- **Persistent Sessions**: Maintain conversation context across page reloads
- **Context Window Management**: Efficiently manage conversation history within model limits
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: Support for follow-up questions and context retention
- **Session Expiry**: Configurable session timeouts

### State Storage
- **Conversation History**: Store and retrieve previous interactions
- **User Preferences**: Remember user settings and preferences
- **Authentication State**: Manage user authentication status

> **Suggestion**: Consider implementing conversation summarization for long conversations to maintain context while staying within token limits.

## Model and Database Integration

### LLM Configuration
- **Pluggable Models**: Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- **Environment Configuration**: Model selection and API keys managed via .env files
- **Fallback Chains**: Automatic fallback to alternative models if primary fails
- **Model-Specific Prompting**: Optimized prompts for different model architectures

> **Question**: Do you need support for local/self-hosted models (Ollama, vLLM) in addition to API-based services?

### Vector Database
- **Pluggable Backend**: Support for multiple vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, PostgreSQL with pgvector)
- **Scalability**: Handle large knowledge bases efficiently
- **Backup and Recovery**: Data persistence and recovery strategies

### Relational Database
- **Metrics Storage**: Store detailed analytics and conversation logs
- **User Management**: Handle user sessions and authentication data
- **Configuration Storage**: Store organization-specific settings
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit log for compliance requirements

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics Collection
- **Query Analytics**:
  - Prompt summary and categorization
  - Response summary and quality metrics
  - Resolution attempt count
  - Query complexity scoring
  - Response time and latency
- **User Behavior**:
  - Conversation flow analysis
  - Drop-off points identification
  - User satisfaction indicators
- **System Performance**:
  - Model usage and costs
  - Cache hit rates
  - Error rates and types

### LangSmith Integration
- **Detailed Tracing**: Complete request/response tracing through the entire pipeline
- **Debug Capabilities**: Step-by-step execution visibility
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prompt strategies and models

> **Question**: What specific metrics are most important for your use case? Customer satisfaction, cost per query, resolution rate?

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Containerization Strategy
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate containers for:
  - Main application server
  - Redis cache
  - Relational database (PostgreSQL)
  - Vector database
  - Background job processors
- **Docker Compose**: Development environment setup
